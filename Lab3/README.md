Lab Explanation:
    In this lab, task 1 contians 2 print methods: print2Darray prints a 2D array, and print2DList prints a 2D ArrayList. Task 2 contains 2 methods that produce running sums for 2D collections across rows or columns depending on the direction specified (1 for left, 2 for right, 3 for up, and 4 for down): runningSum2DArray returns a modified 2D array after producing a running sum in a given direction, and running2DArrayList returns a modified 2D ArrayList after producing a running sum in a given direction. Task 3 contains 4 methods that use different ways to iterate through and print a given ArrayList: printArrayListBasicLoop prints the list with a basic for loop, printArrayEnhancedLoop prints the list with and enhanced (for each) for loop, printArrayListForLoopListIterator prints the list with a for loop using an Iterator, and printArrayListWhileLoopListIterator prints the list with a while loop using an Iterator.
