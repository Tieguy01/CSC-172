Lab Explanation:
    In this lab methods were created to manipulate an array of DNA and RNA sequences contained in LinkedLists, as dictated by commands from a file. These methods included insert - to insert a new sequence into the array, remove - to remove a sequence from the array, print() - to print all the sequences in the array, print(pos) - to print a specified sequence in the array, clip - to replace a sequence of an array with a clipped version of that sequence given a specied start and end position, copy - to copy a sequence from one position in the array to another position, and transcribe - to transcribe a DNA sequence to an RNA sequence.

    The DNAList class houses all these methods and the client. The Sequence class is used to create new Sequence objects that can store a sequence along with what type of sequence it is (DNA or RNA). The LinkedList and Node classes are used for the linked list implementation.
