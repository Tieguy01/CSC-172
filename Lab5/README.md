Code Explanation:
    This code is used to test and compare the runtime various sorting algorithm given seven different sizes of large arrays from 1,000 to 1,000,000 ints. These arrays are presented in four different ways to the algorithms: unsorted, sorted, sorted in reverse, and almost sorted. When run, a text file containing a given array and a sorting algorithm are presented as arguments and runtimes for all four array manupilations are printed.

Compile and Run Information:
    From the commandline, inside the directory of the project:
        ...\Lab5> javac *.java
        ...\Lab5> java Lab5.Sorting <Array File> <Sorting Algorithm (0-5)>
    // this assumes that the set classpath extends to the directory that precedes the package Lab5
